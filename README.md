# New York City Taxi Data Processing, Analysis, Machine Learning Pipelines with Databricks Spark

## Project Objective
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has made publicly available a massive dataset, consisting of billions of taxi records from the city's yellow and green taxis. This project aims to process, analyze, and build machine learning pipelines to gain business insights and predict trip fares. The project uses Spark on Databricks for efficient data processing and transformation, leveraging Azure cloud storage for data storage and scalability.

### Setup (Part 0):

Setting up Azure cloud environment for storing the raw data.
Configuring Databricks environment for big data processing.
### Data Processing (Part 1):

Extracting data from the Azure cloud storage, transforming it using Spark on Databricks, and loading it into a clean, well-structured dataset.
Using SparkSQL for data exploration and preparation.
### Business Analysis (Part 2):

Conducting business analysis using SparkSQL to uncover insights about taxi trips, such as average fare by time of day, distance traveled, or location.
Analyzing trends, peak times, and factors affecting fares.
### Machine Learning Pipelines (Part 3):
